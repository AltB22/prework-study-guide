# Prework Study Guide

## Description

 This project solves the issue of keeping prework study matierials organized and easily accesable.  Throughout the course of the project I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, Javascript, README files like this one, Git, and the GitHub workflow.  My motivation for this project is to learn how to code and to become a developer.
